Welcome back everyone. Today we're diving into one of my favorite passages - Psalm 8. It's a short psalm, but man, it packs a punch.

David starts with these words: "O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is Your name in all the earth, who have set Your glory above the heavens!"

You know what I love about this? David doesn't start with himself. He starts with awe. He starts with wonder. When's the last time you felt genuine wonder at God?

Then in verse 3, he says something incredible: "When I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, the moon and the stars, which You have ordained..."

The work of Your fingers. Not Your hands - Your fingers. Like God was doing something small, almost casual. And yet it's the entire cosmos. Every star you see at night, every galaxy that Hubble telescope reveals - it's fingerwork to God.

Here's the question David asks in verse 4: "What is man that You are mindful of him, and the son of man that You visit him?"

This is the great paradox of the Christian faith. The God who created billions of galaxies with His fingers... thinks about you. Visits you. Is mindful of you.

We live in a world that tells you you're small. Insignificant. A cosmic accident. But Scripture says something radically different. Verse 5: "For You have made him a little lower than the angels, and You have crowned him with glory and honor."

Crowned with glory. You. Not just humanity in general - you specifically. The image of God is stamped on you.

Verse 6: "You have made him to have dominion over the works of Your hands; You have put all things under his feet."

This is the original job description. We're not here to merely exist, to consume, to be entertained. We're here as stewards. As image-bearers. As ambassadors of the King.

Let me ask you something. When you look at your hands - your actual hands - what do you see? Just flesh and bone? Or do you see instruments of purpose?

Your hands were made to create, to serve, to bless. To be extensions of God's kingdom on earth. Whether you're coding software or changing diapers, making meals or making deals - it's all kingdom work when done for His glory.

Here's what I want you to walk away with today: Recover wonder. We've lost it. We've reduced life to a flat screen and a perpetual round of entertainment. We've forgotten how to look up.

Tonight, or tomorrow morning, I want you to actually go outside. Look at the stars. Think about what David thought about. Let the majesty of creation reorient your heart to the majesty of the Creator.

And then remember: the God who made all of that... is mindful of you. Loves you. Has crowned you with glory and honor.

Let that truth change how you see yourself today. Let's pray.
