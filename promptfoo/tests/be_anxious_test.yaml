      You are listening to a message from Thrive Community Church, a church located in Southwest Florida. For more info, visit us at thrive-fl.org. Lord God, this day we start this series, but we wanted to start with you. We want your word to be over us, your truth to be in us, your peace to be upon us. And we pray, Lord God, that you would work through these messages to give us the courage to trust you always, to live according to your promises, to walk out into this world and be up to the calling you've given us. And we just pray, Lord God, that those things that would intimidate us, the fears that surround us, the insecurities within us would fade away and our awe and love of you just take over. Bless, Lord, all the churches in our area, all those who are in mission today. We are thankful that there is one Christian church on earth that we're just a part of. We thank you, Lord, for their partnership in the gospel throughout this whole area. And we pray, Lord, that this fall would be a time of great renewal and gospel growth for your kingdom in southwest Florida. All this we lift up to you in Jesus' name. Amen. So we're starting a new sermon series today, and we're going to be in the fourth chapter of Philippians throughout these three weeks to look at how to be brave, what it means to be brave, what it doesn't as well. And as we do, we're also going to be, I think, going to be sharing a story, a Bible story, each week that kind of goes along with that. Today, at least, we're doing that. And so you're going to have kind of two passages together, okay? So let's read from Philippians chapter 4, verses 4 through 7 to start. Rejoice in the Lord always. Again, I will say rejoice. Let your reasonableness be known to everyone. The Lord is at hand. Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. So today, this three-part series starts, and we're going to look at how to be brave. What does that mean? You know, basic thought is this. It's just not good to live your life intimidated by every situation that comes up. It's just not good that every bad report causes you to shrink back and go, hmm. It's not great to allow people to bully or push you around and define who you are, what you can do, what you can't do, and tell you what to do. That's not what God has in store for you. We all have situations in life where there's basic choices of do we step out, take a risk, or do we shrink back? And today, we're going to be looking at that and how we can be fully following the calling that God has for us and be brave. Now, Paul said much the same to one of his favorite people, I think. Well, he treated him like a son. He never had children of his own, but he treated Timothy like a son. He was a mentee. Paul was his mentor, and he had him grow. They lived together. They worked together. They served together. They were on mission together. And even through all of that, Paul had to remind him of this. He said in 2 Timothy chapter 1 verse 7, For God gave us a spirit, not of fear, but of power and of love and self-control. So that's kind of the theme. That's what God has for you, a spirit of power and love and self-control. You can be brave. Have you ever heard the definition of fear being false, evidence, appearing real? Sometimes that's just what it is. It's like, ooh, this situation. And I look at it, and I see, quote, evidence, and it gets bigger than it is. All of God's children have irrational fears and anxieties. We all do. You know, they seem real, they seem right, they seem like they make sense to us, but from heaven's perspective, from God's perspective, they really don't make any sense. They're irrational. They're things that cause you to shut down, that paralyze you. And in the context of all that God has for us, he's looking at us going like, why are you so afraid? Don't you realize I've got this? Why is it causing you to stop, to pull back, to not try? Irrational fears and anxiety can hem us in so easily. We lose out simply because we're scared, not because we've tried. So you don't apply for that position, or you don't try out for the team because rejection is controlling you and the fear of that rejection, whether it's real or not. Or you won't try a new hobby, or you won't take a new class, or you won't get engaged in a new activity because you don't want to look like a fool. You don't want to feel that way. Or we won't speak to our neighbors, or we don't know what to say to our friends because we are afraid when we speak the gospel message, somehow I'm not competent enough, and therefore I hate feeling out of control. And what if they say something that I don't know what to say to, and if they ask me something and I look ignorant because I really don't know the Bible that well and I don't know... Do you understand how that works? And we pull back and we shrink. So the words from Philippians chapter 4 that we read are pretty familiar, right? Rejoice in the Lord always. Again, I will say rejoice. The Lord is at hand. Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, you know. You've probably seen it cross-stitched somewhere. People still do that. I don't know. Maybe with computer-generated something. I don't know. Or a magnet, or you have it as a bookmark, or you've read it again and again, and you think it's good advice. It's not good advice. It's actually good news, and we're going to get in that today. Don't be anxious about anything. The Greek word there is meromnao. I know it's a big word. Meromnao. And the imagery behind it is fascinating. It occurs numerous times in the New Testament. And the imagery is that it's kind of like you're on this calm sea, and all of a sudden, inside of you, there's this calm sea. And all of a sudden, then, the wind comes, or a storm, or tumult, or something upsets, and everything starts tossing back and forth inside of you. Ever feel that way, right? And the ship of your life starts to fall apart. So it's about being dismembered and divided, and that's kind of behind this word. But it's not always that way. There are times that that passage is actually used, or that word is actually used, meromnao, for something positive. So the word is not in itself the issue. The issue is how we handle the stresses, and the waves, and the winds, and the storms of life. So, for example, Paul says in 1 Corinthians chapter 12, that there may be no division in the body of Christ, and that the members should have the same meromnao, concern or care for one another. So the word can mean simply, you care, you're concerned, and you know what it's like, right? You do care. You should have things that you care about in life. You should have things that really matter to you, and that you are concerned about. The question is how you handle that. So when the waves and the winds come, are you going to surf and sail, or are you going to sink and fall apart? That's the difference with meromnao. And I think this is fascinating. I think there's a story in the Gospel of Mark, specifically, that we're going to look at, that really kind of ties this all together. It gives us a vivid picture of Philippians chapter 4, and what it means to not be anxious about anything, but in everything, in prayer and thanksgiving, make your requests known to God. And the peace that passes all circumstances will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus. And this is a miracle story that Jesus actually accomplished. It historically happened, but it was more than a miracle story. I think it's also a lesson, a teaching lesson. And Mark records this because it's so important. Jesus is in the stern of the boat asleep. Now, he probably was there because he was exhausted, and he could sleep through the storm because he was so dog-tired from all the ministry and opportunities with the crowds that he had before this. And you can read that in the Gospel. But I think he also was teaching a lesson. Do you realize just a year, year and a half, maybe two years after this incident, Peter and the rest of the disciples will not have Jesus physically, visibly, and present anymore. It's kind of like as if he were asleep in the boat. They know he's there, but how is he there? And what do you do and how do you handle things? And all of a sudden, they're going to face difficulties in life like this storm. What do they do? How do they learn the lesson? What lesson are they to learn? And they cried out to Jesus in the midst of the storm. Don't you care that we're dying here? You get it. Now, you might be able to see that. Now, there's no question in my mind that they should have been anxious. There should have been concerned some mirror. I'm not going on there. They should have been concerned for their lives. But the way they handled it at that time was to jump to the conclusion. Don't you care? And the conclusion was. God must not care. Jesus doesn't care what's going on here. He doesn't care about my life. Ever see that happen when bad times happen in a Christian's life or anybody's life? They believe in God in some generic sense. But then all of a sudden, if this is going, how could God ever care? Why in the world is this all going on? The waves and the tempest and the sea are, you know, it's roiling around. Everything's falling apart in your life and you go like, God, don't you even care? And we jump to that conclusion. Where is God in the middle of all this? And this story is saying he's right in the boat with you. He is not off to the side. He is not standing on the shoreline. He's not looking at you from a distance. He is right there with you. And notice why I said Philippians chapter four is not just good advice. Don't worry about anything. The Bible doesn't say don't worry because worries bad for you. You know, anxiety is a killer, even though that might be true. The good news happens in that passage. It says this. The Lord is at your hand. Do not be anxious about anything. So the reason not to worry is that the Lord is right there. He's in the boat with you. He's right by your side. He may not be visible. You might think he's sleeping, but he's got it. I think Peter learned this lesson because later on in his life, you see him handling circumstances that are very difficult. He faced all sorts of things in his life and he is writing advice. He is writing the truth to churches that were facing persecution and difficulty and struggles and threats from outside of themselves. And he says this in first Peter five, casting all your anxieties on him because he cares for you. So what he learned is that in the midst of the storm, you've got a God who's right there with you and who does care for you, period. So, how do we live? How do we live brave? I think we've got three things to hold on to from these texts. First of all, we have God's presence. Jesus is in our boat. He says, I am with you always, to the very end of the age. Jesus said he chooses to be in the midst of your storms in your life. He never leaves you. He'll never forsake you. Jesus says he has begun a good work in you. This is in the book of Philippians. He'll bring it to completion in Jesus Christ. The good news is Christ is with us always. Secondly, God's future plans. You know that phrase that says the Lord is at hand in the book of Philippians in chapter four? Therefore, don't worry. It's not just that Jesus is present right here, right now, but the fact that his coming again, his glory, his kingdom that he is ushering in is just at the doorstep. At any moment, he has a future plan for you. You are part of it. It's coming. No nation, no power, no one, nothing in all of this world will ever thwart the kingdom of God and the reign of God through his son Jesus Christ that is coming to this whole of creation. He's the one who holds it all together. He's the future direction of where things are going. And so God has a future plan for you. It may look a little messy right now. You might be tossed here and there. But instead of letting the waves break you apart, learn to let the wind fill your sail and learn how to surf on those waves. Finally, this really comes down to God's promises. He's not a bystander in your life. Like I said before, when he says something, he means it. And he put his life at stake for every word. Jesus is the word that was made flesh. He lived out everything that God has intended for you. And he gives it to you freely and he's there for you always. So there's no question that you might be saved or not. For God so loved the world, he gave his only son that whoever believes in him will have eternal life. There's no question that whether you are loved because nothing will separate you from the love of God and Jesus Christ. There's no question that you will one day be glorified because those whom he justified, he has sanctified and he will glorify, as Romans 8 says. Let's pray. Lord God, you know our fears. You know how we've tried to do our own way and I ask, Lord, now that you... Well, you've called us into your boat. You've called us to be your very own, each one of us. I pray especially for those here today that have realized maybe they've been in the wrong vessel all along. They've been trying to run their lives and handle the storms on their own. Lord, I pray, you know, help them to just trust you now and get in. We welcome you, Lord. We ask, Lord, too, for those of us who've been in... You've been in our boat. I mean, you're there, but we've thought you don't even care. Somehow these storms we care more about than the fact that you are with us. Forgive us for that, Lord. Give us a true fear of you, a love for you that so overwhelms us that everything else falls into place. Lord, I pray that through this series, we as a church, as a community, as well as individuals will become brave all because of you. In your name, amen.
