      You are listening to a message from Thrive Community Church, a church located in Southwest Florida. For more info, visit us at thrive-fl.org. Good morning, everyone. My name is Phil Klopke, and I have a confession to make. I am a recovering hypocrite. Now, before you get too excited, let me clarify. I'm not confessing to some scandalous sin. I'm not about to reveal some deep, dark secret. I'm simply admitting what I think most of us, if we're honest, would have to admit. I am a hypocrite. I say one thing and do another. I preach one thing and practice another. I hold others to standards that I don't always hold myself to. And I suspect I'm not alone. So today, I want to talk about hypocrisy. What it is. Why it's so dangerous. And how we can recover from it. Let's read from James chapter 1, verses 19 through 27. Know this, my beloved brothers: let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger; for the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God. Therefore put away all filthiness and rampant wickedness and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls. But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror. For he looks at himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like. But the one who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and perseveres, being no hearer who forgets but a doer who acts, he will be blessed in his doing. If anyone thinks he is religious and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart, this person's religion is worthless. Religion that is pure and undefiled before God the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world. So what is hypocrisy? The word comes from the Greek word hypokrites, which means actor. In ancient Greek theater, actors would wear masks to play different characters. And so a hypocrite is someone who wears a mask. Someone who pretends to be something they're not. Someone who plays a role. And I think we all do this to some extent. We all wear masks. We all pretend. We all play roles. We have our church mask. Our work mask. Our social media mask. Our family mask. And we switch between them depending on the situation. And that's hypocrisy. Now, James doesn't use the word hypocrisy in this passage. But he describes it perfectly. He talks about people who hear the word but don't do it. People who look in the mirror and then forget what they look like. People who think they're religious but don't bridle their tongue. People who deceive themselves. That's hypocrisy. And James says it's dangerous. He says that if you're a hearer of the word and not a doer, you're deceiving yourself. You're fooling yourself. You think you're okay, but you're not. You think you're religious, but your religion is worthless. You think you're a Christian, but you're not living like one. And that's the danger of hypocrisy. It blinds us to our own condition. It makes us think we're better than we are. It makes us comfortable in our sin. It makes us judgmental of others while ignoring our own faults. And it makes our faith ineffective. Because people can see through our masks. They can tell when we're being fake. They can sense when our words don't match our actions. And when they see that, they don't want anything to do with our faith. They don't want anything to do with our God. And so our hypocrisy becomes a stumbling block to others. So how do we recover from hypocrisy? Well, I think the first step is to admit it. We have to be honest with ourselves. We have to acknowledge that we are hypocrites. We have to stop pretending that we have it all together. We have to stop acting like we're better than everyone else. We have to take off our masks and be real. And that's hard. Because we like our masks. Our masks protect us. Our masks make us look good. Our masks hide our flaws. But our masks also keep us from growing. Our masks keep us from being authentic. Our masks keep us from experiencing true community. So we have to take them off. The second step is to look in the mirror. James says that the person who hears the word but doesn't do it is like someone who looks in a mirror and then forgets what they look like. But the person who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and perseveres, that person will be blessed. So we need to look in the mirror of God's word. We need to see ourselves as we really are. We need to let the word expose our hypocrisy. We need to let the word convict us. We need to let the word change us. And we need to keep looking. We need to persevere. We need to not forget what we see. The third step is to do the word. James says, Be doers of the word, and not hearers only. It's not enough to hear the word. It's not enough to know the word. It's not enough to agree with the word. We have to do the word. We have to put it into practice. We have to live it out. And that's where the rubber meets the road. That's where hypocrisy is exposed. Because it's easy to say the right things. It's easy to believe the right things. But it's hard to do the right things. It's hard to love your enemies. It's hard to forgive those who hurt you. It's hard to serve others. It's hard to be generous. It's hard to be patient. It's hard to be kind. But that's what we're called to do. And when we do it, our faith becomes real. Our faith becomes authentic. Our faith becomes attractive. The fourth step is to bridle your tongue. James says, If anyone thinks he is religious and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart, this person's religion is worthless. Our words matter. What we say matters. How we say it matters. And so often, our hypocrisy is revealed in our words. We say we love people, but then we gossip about them. We say we're not judgmental, but then we criticize others. We say we're patient, but then we snap at people. We say we're kind, but then we're sarcastic and cutting. And so we need to bridle our tongue. We need to be quick to hear and slow to speak. We need to think before we talk. We need to let our words be gracious and kind. The fifth step is to care for others. James says, Religion that is pure and undefiled before God the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction. True religion is not about rituals. It's not about rules. It's not about looking good. It's about caring for others. It's about serving others. It's about loving others. And when we do that, our faith becomes real. Our faith becomes authentic. Our faith becomes attractive. So let me close with this. I am a recovering hypocrite. And I suspect you are too. But here's the good news. God knows we're hypocrites. And he loves us anyway. He sent his Son to die for hypocrites like us. He offers us grace and forgiveness. He offers us the power to change. He offers us the Holy Spirit to help us become who we're supposed to be. So let's take off our masks. Let's look in the mirror. Let's do the word. Let's bridle our tongue. Let's care for others. And let's become the people God has called us to be. Not perfect people. But authentic people. Not people who have it all together. But people who are honest about their struggles. Not people who pretend. But people who are real. That's what it means to be a recovering hypocrite. Let's pray. Lord God, we confess that we are hypocrites. We confess that we wear masks. We confess that we say one thing and do another. Forgive us, Lord. Help us to be honest with ourselves. Help us to look in the mirror of your word. Help us to be doers of the word and not hearers only. Help us to bridle our tongue. Help us to care for others. And help us to become the people you have called us to be. We thank you for your grace. We thank you for your forgiveness. We thank you for your power to change. All this we pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
