      We're in our second in the series called Fathom, which is a study in the letter of Ephesians, and we're trying to fathom the height and depth and breadth and width of the love of God. It's like trying to measure that is almost like trying to measure the ocean, or better, the universe. It's really not possible, but you can be in awe of it more and more.

      Let's read Ephesians 2, 1 through 10. And you were dead in your trespasses and sins in which you once walked, following the course of this world. But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ, by grace you have been saved, and raised us up with him, and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.

      For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing, it is the gift of God, not of results of work, so that no one may boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.

      Grace. I said we need to fathom the height and breadth and width and depth of what this is. And when you do, I think the response is going to be just awe and wonder. Awe and wonder and gratitude and joy.

      But what is grace? How do you define that word? In Ephesians 2:8-9, I think it comes up with part of the best definition. It is for by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing, it is a gift of God, not a result of works. So right there you kind of get the definition that grace is gift. It's free. You don't earn it. You can't deserve it. It's given.

      But you get a lot of free things in life. You probably got a lot of free advice, and that's about what it's worth, right? Or you can get a lot of gifts in life, but they don't necessarily change your life. For instance, your child might have gotten a Nintendo Switch at Christmas. Did it change your life? Not really. No, it's just more of the same.

      But think of the gifts in your life that actually changed you. Imagine you are a poor person in Haiti. No running water, no electricity, absolutely no job. And you need an operation to save your life. But the medical care is not there even in the entire nation of Haiti. And you couldn't afford it even if it were.

      But then somebody comes along. They hear about your situation. And they pay for the whole thing freely, no strings attached. They pay for you to fly to the United States to get the medical treatment you need and fly you back, everything. That's a little different of a free gift, isn't it? Makes all the difference.

      When we say grace is a free gift from God, we're not talking about a Nintendo Switch or a T-shirt or a notepad. We're talking about a life-changing gift that has changed your entire eternity.

      So today, from this passage, we're going to learn these three things. First of all, that grace is indispensable. Secondly, that it is infinitely costly. And thirdly, that it will bring you unfathomable joy.

      It's indispensable. And this is where, why is it indispensable? It's partly because of our condition. And this comes up in that first verse. And you were dead in your trespasses and sins. Dead. There's a big difference between being sick and being dead.

      If Paul could have said, and you were sick in your transgressions and sins, that you were in a bad place. But when you're dead, you don't even need a doctor. You need a resurrection. And that's what Paul is saying about us in this passage.

      He's not saying that we get to call on God and say, Dr. God, can you give me a tonic here or a pill because I just need a little help? It's not about that at all. Paul says that we are dead in our transgressions and sins.

      That's why God's grace is indispensable. Indispensable. Without it, I'm lost. I'm dead. That's what this text says. And when we receive it, you know what it does? Creates humility. Real humility.

      So Jesus, in the Sermon on the Mount, his first word, his first beatitude, blessed are, he says, the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. And that word poor in spirit doesn't mean blessed are those who are in a little of a pinch. The word is really spiritually bankrupt, zip, zero, nada, nothing.

      It's that I go before God. If I have anything, I'm going to bargain with God. But when I realize I have nothing on God but his promises, there's no more bargaining with God. And actually, that's when I receive the free gift of grace.

      Secondly, it's infinitely costly. This comes in that middle passage, Ephesians 2, 4 to 7. God, rich in his mercy because of great love. And there are three verbs in this. Made us alive together, raised us up with him, and seated us with him.

      What he is saying is that you are incorporated into the very life of Jesus Christ. You are united with Jesus Christ. You are connected to him so that whatever he deserves, you get. The moment you believed everything that he earned through his perfect life, his complete sacrificial death and his glorious resurrection are now yours.

      And the costly nature of this is there's a backside to this. That everything that is his is now yours, but everything that is yours is now his. He gets all my sin. He gets all my mistakes. He gets all my rebellion. Everything that I deserve, he takes on himself.

      That is why Paul writes in 2 Corinthians, he who knew no sin made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.

      We cannot quantify the cost that Jesus paid. Jesus didn't just liquidate his assets. He poured out his very life on the cross. That's the cost.

      And how do you respond to that? I think this is where unfathomable joy and gratitude come in. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.

      It's like, wow, what else do I get to do with my life? You get to follow Jesus, you get to do the things that Jesus did, and you get to do it for the reasons Jesus did it, just out of love. You don't have to even keep track of it.

      One of the greatest pieces of literature that deals with grace in all of Western civilization is Les Miserables. In it, John Valjean, who's been in prison unjustly, becomes bitter, comes out of prison, and is taken in by a Catholic bishop. Though he's shown grace and mercy and care by this bishop, that night, John Valjean steals his silverware and takes off.

      John Valjean gets caught. The police bring him back to the cardinal, and they say, hey, we caught this thief. He stole your silverware. And you know what the cardinal does? He's gracious beyond belief. He goes, oh, no, no, no. He didn't, no, I gave him the silverware. Oh, by the way, here are the silver candlesticks.

      And then the cardinal says, John Valjean, my brother, you no longer belong to evil but to good. It is your soul that I buy from you. I withdraw it from your black thoughts and the spirit of perdition, and I give it to God.

      Do you realize Jesus has said basically that to you? You are no longer dead. You are alive. You are no longer in sin. You are in grace. I have purchased your soul by my very life.

      Fathom that grace. Indispensable, unobtainable on your own, costly, and giving you that kind of joy.
