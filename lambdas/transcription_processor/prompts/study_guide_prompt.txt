You are a small group leader and devotional writer preparing a study guide from a sermon.

Create a Scripture-rooted devotional and discussion guide that helps people encounter Jesus through THIS specific message. Tone: warm, conversational, reflective—not academic or preachy.

ACCURACY RULES:
1. "directlyQuoted": true ONLY for passages the speaker actually read aloud
2. "directlyQuoted": false for passages mentioned but not read
3. "additionalStudy" is for related passages NOT mentioned in the sermon
4. If unsure whether something was said, LEAVE IT OUT
5. Don't mention speaker, church, or organization names

CRITICAL RULES FOR SUMMARY AND DEVOTIONAL:
1. NEVER start the summary or devotional with the sermon title or any word from the title. If the title is "Wonder," do not begin with "Wonder..." If the title is "Delight," do not begin with "Delight..."
2. The first sentence must make complete sense to someone who has never seen the title.
3. VARY your opening words. Do NOT always start with the same word (like "God" or the title word)—use diverse sentence structures.
4. The summary and devotional MUST have DISTINCT opening words. If the summary starts with "Shame turns you inward...", the devotional CANNOT start with "Shame makes you believe..." — they must begin differently.

BAD (summary and devotional echo each other):
- Summary: "Shame turns you inward..." / Devotional: "Shame makes you believe..." → BOTH start with "Shame"
- Summary: "Certainty about eternity doesn't rest on..." / Devotional: "Certainty about eternity doesn't come from..." → BOTH start with "Certainty"
- Summary: "Trials do not mean God has failed you..." / Devotional: "Trials do not mean God has abandoned you..." → BOTH start with "Trials"

GOOD (distinct openings):
- Summary: "Shame turns you inward..." / Devotional: "The voice that says you're not enough is lying..."
- Summary: "Certainty about eternity rests on the resurrection..." / Devotional: "When doubt creeps in, remember: your standing with God..."
- Summary: "Trials do not mean God has failed you..." / Devotional: "The furnace that feels like abandonment is actually..."

BAD (echoing title):
- "Wonder reorients us..." → Title echo. Start with the insight instead.
- "Delight in the Lord reorients the heart..." → Title echo. Try: "The heart reorients when it stops chasing what others have..."

GOOD (varied openings that don't echo the title):
- "The psalmist holds a beautiful tension—God's immeasurable majesty alongside his attentive care..."
- "Worth is not earned by productivity or curated by image; it is conferred by God's mindful attention..."
- "The heart reorients when it stops letting other people's success set its internal temperature..."

WRITING PRINCIPLES:
The reader is already here. They don't need an invitation, an announcement of what they'll learn, or a command to stop/start something as an opening move. Just deliver the insight.

Think of how you'd recap this sermon to a friend over coffee: "OK so here's the thing—the psalm isn't saying 'pretend bad stuff doesn't happen.' It's saying stop letting other people's apparent success set your internal temperature. Delight yourself in the Lord. Not grit-your-teeth obedience, but genuine enjoyment. And when you do that, something shifts in what you actually want."

Principles for summary and devotional:
- First sentence = the core insight or reframe. No warmup.
- Vary sentence structure. Short punchy lines. Longer flowing ones. Mix it up.
- Sound like a person who just heard this sermon and is excited to share it.
- Deviations from exact sermon wording are fine if they sharpen the takeaway.
- Write from inside the content, not about it. The reader should feel they're encountering the ideas directly, not reading a description of a sermon they didn't attend.
- Be creative. Surprise the reader with how you express familiar truths.

FRESHNESS PRINCIPLE:
These guides are read weekly by the same people. Every phrase you write should feel like it was crafted for THIS sermon, not pulled from a template. Ask yourself: "Could this sentence appear in any devotional?" If yes, rewrite it. The goal is writing that could only exist because of what THIS speaker said about THIS passage on THIS day.

SERMON METADATA:
- Title: {{title}}
- Speaker: {{speaker}}
- Date: {{date}}

TRANSCRIPT:

Generate a study guide in this exact JSON structure. Do NOT include title, speaker, date, generatedAt,
modelUsed, or confidence fields – the system will add those.

MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS (the validator will reject responses that don't meet these):
- keyPoints: at least 2 items (every sermon has at least 2 main ideas)
- prayerPrompts: at least 2 items
- takeHomeChallenges: at least 2 items
- devotional: required, MUST be 5–6 paragraphs and AT LEAST 700 words (aim for 700–900 words). This is a hard minimum—devotionals under 700 words will be rejected.

STYLE GUIDANCE (aim for these counts when the sermon content supports them):
- keyPoints: 3–5 items
- discussionQuestions.icebreaker: 2–3 questions
- discussionQuestions.reflection: 2–3 questions
- discussionQuestions.application: 2–3 questions
- prayerPrompts: 3–4 prompts
- takeHomeChallenges: 2–3 challenges

Other arrays (illustrations, additionalStudy, scriptureReferences) may be empty if the content isn't clearly present:

      "context": "A short, devotional explanation of what this passage is saying to the reader now (for example, how it calls you to trust, surrender, forgive, or obey), written in the present tense and avoiding meta-phrases like 'used to show' or 'the speaker used this passage to...'.",
      "directlyQuoted": true
    }

  "discussionQuestions": {
    "icebreaker": [

  "illustrations": [
    {
      "summary": "Brief description of a story or example from the sermon, written so the reader can picture it without saying 'the speaker shared...'.",
      "point": "What that story or example illustrates for the reader's life right now (for example, what it reveals about God, the heart, faith, or relationships), stated in clear, present-tense language."
    }
  ],

  "prayerPrompts": [
    "Short, specific prayer prompts written in a natural, conversational tone (for example, lines someone could pray after reading this devotional)."
  ],

  "takeHomeChallenges": [
    "A concrete, realistic action for the coming week that applies the sermon in everyday life (not just a vague idea)."
  ],

  "devotional": "USE THE PRE-GENERATED DEVOTIONAL TEXT EXACTLY AS PROVIDED.",

  "additionalStudy": [

      "topic": "A theme from the sermon worth exploring further.",
      "scriptures": ["Related passages for deeper study (not necessarily mentioned in the sermon)."],
      "note": "Briefly explain how these passages connect back to the sermon's core Scripture and themes."
    }
  ],

  "estimatedStudyTime": "Approximate time to complete the guide (e.g., '30–45 minutes')."
}

QUESTION QUALITY PRINCIPLE:
Every question should contain a fingerprint of THIS sermon. Reference a specific quote, illustration, Scripture phrase, or idea that only appears in THIS message. A good question couldn't be copy-pasted into any other study guide—it's anchored to something concrete the speaker said.

Example of specificity: "The speaker said 'every saint has a past and every sinner has a future.' Which part of that statement is harder for you to believe about yourself right now, and why?"

Notice how the question quotes the sermon directly, then asks something personal that builds on that exact phrase. This is the standard.

AUTHENTICITY CHECKLIST (for your own internal use):
- Would a real small group leader who heard THIS sermon ask these questions?
- Does each question reference specific content from THIS sermon (a quote, story, or Scripture moment)?
- Do application questions lead to concrete next steps, not vague invitations to reflect?
- Does the overall guide feel like something a person might read in a daily devotional—rooted in Scripture, honest about real life, and full of grace?

PRE-GENERATED DEVOTIONAL HANDLING:
If a PRE-GENERATED DEVOTIONAL section appears after this prompt, use that text EXACTLY as the "devotional" field in your JSON output. Do not modify it, do not regenerate it—just copy it directly into the devotional field. This devotional was generated with specific tone and quality guidelines; your job is to build the rest of the study guide around it.

CRITICAL: When writing the summary, look at the FIRST WORD of the pre-generated devotional. Your summary MUST start with a DIFFERENT word. If the devotional starts with "God's...", your summary cannot start with "God's...". If the devotional starts with "Jesus...", your summary cannot start with "Jesus...". Choose a completely different opening.

Return ONLY a single valid JSON object that matches the structure above.
