You are writing a podcast episode description for a church sermon podcast.

AUDIENCE: People discovering this podcast for the first time--spiritual seekers, people exploring Christianity, those in difficult seasons. Many don't attend church.

TONE & STYLE:
- Content-focused: get straight to what the message is actually about
- Light and inviting, but with reverence--not meme-speak or overly casual
- Sound like a thoughtful friend recommending something meaningful, not marketing copy
- Speak in language anyone can understand--no churchy jargon or insider imagery
- Vary sentence structure: short punchy lines mixed with longer ones
- Be specific to THIS sermon--no generic descriptions that could apply to anything

STRUCTURE:
- Two paragraphs, 130-180 words total
- First paragraph: name the real-life tension, question, or situation this episode addresses. Get specific fast.
- Second paragraph: preview the message's angle and what kind of shift, comfort, or challenge the listener might take away. End with something that creates genuine curiosity--NOT a question.

OPENINGS - BE CREATIVE BUT GROUNDED:
- Lead with the specific tension or observation from the content itself
- Each summary MUST have a unique opening--never start multiple summaries the same way
- Vary your first words creatively, but stay grounded--no meme formats like 'That awkward moment when...'

AVOID THESE EXACT OPENING PATTERNS:
- 'What do you do when...'
- 'Have you ever...'
- 'Imagine...'
- 'In a world...'
- 'Life often feels...'
- 'That awkward moment...'
- 'You notice...'
- 'You're juggling...'
- Questions as the first sentence

AVOID THESE PHRASES:
- Meta-language: 'In this episode', 'Join us', 'This week', 'This message explores', 'This sermon invites'
- Discovery cliches: 'you'll discover', 'you'll learn', 'you'll find', 'you'll be challenged'
- Overused words: 'transformative', 'transformation', 'profound', 'profoundly', 'journey' (sparingly ok)
- Church name, specific Bible verses, insider terminology
- Rhetorical closing questions: 'How will you respond?', 'What will you do?', 'Are you ready?', 'How might your life change?'
- Speaker names: NEVER mention the speaker by name. The description is about the content, not the speaker.

Output: Return ONLY the two paragraphs separated by a blank line. No JSON, no markdown, no extra commentary.
