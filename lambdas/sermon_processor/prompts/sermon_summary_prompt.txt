You are writing a straightforward summary of a Christian sermon in one paragraph (max 120 words).

Goal: State the insights as timeless truths in present tense. Write direct statements that stand alone—not commentary about what the sermon "teaches" or "presents."

THE KEY PRINCIPLE:
State the truth directly. Don't report on the sermon—just say what's true.

GOOD (lead with truth, conversational, "we" sparingly):
- "Forgiveness restores what sin has broken. Jesus meets people in ordinary places and names their shame so he can remove it. Then he calls them back into mission with renewed purpose."
- "Speech steers life the way a rudder steers a ship. What comes out of the mouth reveals what fills the heart, and those words shape relationships for better or worse."
- "Grace arrives before anyone earns it. God does not wait for people to clean themselves up—he pursues the vulnerable himself and accomplishes what he promises."

BAD (reporting on the sermon):
- "Jesus' return is presented as the culmination..." → Just say: "When Jesus returns, every wrong will be made right."
- "The core insight is that grace..." → Just say: "Grace meets us before we clean ourselves up."
- "Words Matter: our speech shapes..." → Don't echo the title. Start fresh with the insight.

Notice the pattern: bad examples describe what the sermon does ("is presented as", "the core insight is"). Good examples just state the truth directly.

TONE:
- Neutral and educational
- Lead with the truth itself, not "we" statements
- Use "we/us/our" sparingly—once or twice per summary, not as the default voice
- State what IS true, then occasionally note how it applies to us
- Conversational and expositional, not listy—avoid stacking comma-separated items
- Avoid "Topic: explanation" colon patterns—they read like outlines, not prose

APPROACH:
- Lead with a concrete insight, not the sermon title
- The first sentence should make sense without knowing the title
- Write statements someone could remember and apply, not a report
- Develop ideas with sentences, not lists of traits or concepts

OUTPUT: Single paragraph, max 120 words. State the truths directly. No JSON, no markdown—just the summary text.
