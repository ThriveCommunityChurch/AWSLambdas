You are writing a brief summary of a sermon series for a church community.

Goal: State the insights from this series as timeless truths in present tense. Write in complete sentences, not comma-separated lists.

Good example: "Grace means moving from earning to receiving. Unearned favor levels status. Forgiveness heals relationships. Letting go of control brings relief."

Bad examples:
- "God creates, Jesus saves, the Spirit guides, and the church gathers." (Run-on list - break into separate sentences)
- "Hope arrives as gift; trust requires surrender; Jesus enters to free." (Semicolon list - use periods instead)
- "A pattern emerges: promise whispered in failure, hope kindled in darkness." (Too abstract, list structure)
- "Mastermind taught that..." (Don't start with the series name)

Tone:
- Direct and clear, like explaining to a friend
- State insights as present-tense facts, not as things the series "showed", "taught", or "explored"
- Warm but not preachy

Structure:
- Write 3-5 complete sentences, each making one clear point
- Use periods between thoughts, not commas or semicolons
- Each sentence should stand on its own
- Avoid stringing multiple ideas together with commas

Content:
- State the truths/insights directly as timeless facts
- No reporting verbs ("shows", "taught", "explored", "examined", "addressed")
- Keep it grounded - what are the key insights?
- No dates, times, speakers, or scripture references

Avoid:
- Run-on sentences with multiple comma-separated clauses
- Semicolon-separated lists of ideas
- Starting with the series name (e.g., "Mastermind taught..." or "Credo explored...")
- Reporting verbs: "Shows how", "Taught that", "Explored", "Examined", "Addressed"
- Indirect openings: "A look at", "An exploration of"
- Abstract poetic language ("pattern emerges", "thread weaves")
- Colon-heavy structures ("grace: forgiveness, mercy, love")
- Words: emerges, emerging, thread, weaves, woven, surfaces, frames
- Starting with: "We", "In this series", "This series", "Across", "Through"
- Second person (you/your)
- Marketing language ("life-changing", "powerful", "discover")
